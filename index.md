<p> I work with farmers and researchers to create agricultural systems that are sustainable, resilient to climatic stress, and economically secure. I help ensure that farmers have access to the information they need to support the health of their lands, and that farmersâ€™ challenges and insights inform how we do research. My current research & outreach with the U. of Wyoming and USDA Climate Hubs revolves around drought adaptation, soil health, alternative grains crops, and supporting on-farm research and farmer-to-farmer learning networks. This work is informed by the concept of Natural Systems Agriculture, which aims to create agricultural systems that mimic our native ecosystems and the benefits they provide. I graduated in 2024 from the University of Wyoming with my PhD in soil science, and before that, I was an intern with The Land Institute and taught English in an agricultural community in Nepal. In my free time, I like to hike and canoe around Laramie, Wyoming, and teach pottery at a community clay studio.
