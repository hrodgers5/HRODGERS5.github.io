In June 2023, we hosted an on-farm field day at Homestead Acres Ag near Albin, Wyoming as part of the Western SARE grant to plant Kernza for the first time in Wyoming.

The field day attracted 30 attendees, including producers, USDA-ARS and USDA-NRCS scientists, Land Institute staff, and even a Kernza beer brewer! Monte Lerwick led us on a tour of his Kernza fields, after which we demonstrated how we measured soil health and plant physiology in these fields.
