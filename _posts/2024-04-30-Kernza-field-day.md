Despite In 2023, Chandan Shilpakar and I received a grant from the Wyoming Center for Global Studies to establish a teaching orchard at a school in Nepal and help Nepali families gain the resources and knowledge to grow higher-value crops. We travelled to the research farm (Biloba Organic) and participating school winter of 2023 to help initiate the project and lead a soil health workshop. The project now has 25 apple, peach, coffee, and orange trees managed by a local school’s “Eco-Club,” and plans to expand to a second school!

To build upon the enormous amount of generational agricultural knowledge in this region, and to support under-resourced farmers without disrupting indigenous ways of farming by introducing high-value fruit and nut crops.

This project was a collaboration between Biloba Organic (a research farm halfway between Kathmandu, Nepal and Tibet), the nearby Shree ___ Secondary School, and the University of Wyoming Center for Global Studies. We coordinated between these partners to establish a teaching orchard at the school that could help Nepali families gain the resources and knowledge to grow higher-value crops.
