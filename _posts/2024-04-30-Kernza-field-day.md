In June 2023, we hosted an on-farm field day at Homestead Acres Ag near Albin, Wyoming as part of the Western SARE grant to plant Kernza for the first time in Wyoming.
We had 30 attendees, including producers, USDA-ARS and USDA-NRCS scientists, Land Institute staff, and even a Kernza beer brewer! Our farmer collaborator, Monte
Lerwick, led us on a farm tour of his Kernza fields and we gave short workshops on how we measured soil health and plant physiology in these fields, assisted by University of Wyoming undergraduate students.
