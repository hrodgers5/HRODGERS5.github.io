We presented an all-ages activity at the Albany County and Laramie County Ag & Arts Tours, organized by University of Wyoming Extension. Participants looked up the typical soil profile of their home, farm, or ranch through [SoilWeb](https://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/gmap/), discussed it, then used soil-based watercolor paints from [The Art of Soil](https://theartofsoil.com/) to paint bookmarks of their soil profile.
