The Kernza® in Context educational curriculum was designed to use the story of Kernza® perennial grain to teach students about ecological and social concepts such as plant breeding and genetics, climate change, agricultural supply chains, and how research is performed. I contributed in helping create lessons based on my work with Kernza, soil health, and soil microbiology. The full curriculum can be accessed [here](https://kernza.org/kernza-curriculum/).
