As part of my work with the Climate Hub, I developed a workshop on soil health and climate-resilient agriculture for middle and high school students. The workshop has students collect soils from nearby that they believe to be "healthy" or "unhealthy," and then test their guess by measuring some simple soil properties such as organic matter (by color), pH, nitrate, and texture.

We then discuss the functions of a healthy soil, and how these soil properties impact a soil's ability to perform these functions and support a healthy, climate-resilient ecosystem, especially as it relates to water storage and drought.

These workshops draw from Jay Norton's [Garden Soil Health Handbook](https://soilmanagement.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/garden-soil-health-handbook-012319.pdf).
