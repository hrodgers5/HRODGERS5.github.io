As part of my work with the Climate Hub, I've been giving workshops on soil health and climate to groups of students ranging from elementary to college level. The workshop has students collect soils from nearby that they believe to be "healthy" or "unhealthy," and then we test their guess by measuring some simple soil properties such as organic matter (by color), pH, nitrate, and texture.

We discuss the functions of a healthy soil, and how these soil properties impact a soil's ability to perform these functions and support a healthy, climate-resilient ecosystem.

These workshops draw from Jay Norton's [Garden Soil Health Handbook](https://soilmanagement.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/garden-soil-health-handbook-012319.pdf).
