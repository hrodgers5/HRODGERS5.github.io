Genetic Diversity of Native Plant Populations
</h3>
Seed-based restoration after wildfires is common throughout the Great Basin. Native perennial grass species are often included in the seed mix to prevent soil erosion and to provide forage. What are the effects of large-scale seeding on the genetic diversity of native grass populations? I am exploring this question by genotyping bluebunch wheatgrass (<i>Pseudoroegneria spicata</i>) in an area affected by Soda Fire in 2015.

Forward-looking Seed Sourcing
</h3>
Seed sourcing is an important decision practitioners make in restoration. The common strategy is to use local seeds assuming that local plants are best adapted to their environment. Will the plants we seed now persist into the future? I conducted a field common garden experiment and found that seed sourcing that considers anticipated future environmental conditions of a restoration site can improve restoration success in moderate drought. To examine what the roots are doing belowground, I conducted a greenhouse experiment and found that the trade-offs in drought tolerance (higher fine roots) and invasive resistant (higher SLA) seedling traits complicate the seed selection process.

Functional Diversity and Productivity
</h3>
Does functional diversity buffer plant communities from drought? Combining plant response data from a rainfall manipulation experiment and greenhouse trait measurements, we found that functional diversity buffered biomass production by enabling shifts in above-and belowground functional traits across variable rainfall conditions.

Application of Modern Coexistence Theory
</h3>
How do we know when restoration is successful? Fluctuating populations and changing starting conditions make evaluation of restoration success tricky. As part of an iDiv working group, I led a study on applying demographic modeling and principles from Modern Coexistence Theory to rare plant restoration. Using a long-term monitoring data of an endangered species, Contra Costa goldfields (<i>Lasthenia conjugens</i>), from a vernal pool restoration project, we found that model-derived low-density growth rates and per capita intrinsic growth rates were reliable metrics for diagnosing long-term restoration trajectories.

Ecological Site Description and Ecosystem Services
</h3>
How do we manage for multiple ecosystem services? We found that the Ecological Site Description framework developed primarily to manage forage on heterogeneous rangeland landscapes has potential to be useful for managing other resources such as plant biodiversity and soil carbon at a ranch-level.

Perception of Rangeland Conservation
</h3>
What are the barriers and opportunities for rangeland conservation in California? In a patchwork of private and public lands, California's rangeland conservation hinges on partnerships across multiple stakeholders. I interviewed ranchers, land managers, and academics in the Central Coast Rangeland Coalition to understand how they perceive rangeland conservation.
