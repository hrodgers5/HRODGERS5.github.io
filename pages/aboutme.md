I work with farmers and researchers to create agricultural systems that are sustainable, resilient to climatic stress, and economically secure. I help make sure both that the science reaches farmers, and that farmers' challenges and insights inform how we do research. My current work focuses on topics like soil health management, alternative grains crops, incorporating perennials, and supporting on-farm research and farmer-to-farmer information sharing. My work is informed by the concept of Natural Systems Agriculture, which aims to create agricultural systems that mimic our native ecosystems and the benefits they provide. In my free time, I likes to hike, bike, and canoe around Laramie, Wyoming, and teach pottery at a community-run studio.  


Some of my past experiences include:  

* A PhD in soil science from the University of Wyoming, 2020-2024  
* Farming and teaching English in Nepal as a Fulbright Scholar, 2019  
* Studying perennial grains as an intern at The Land Institute, 2018  
* A Bachelors in biology and neuroscience from Oberlin College, 2014-2018  
* Studying climate change and land use as a field technician with the National Ecological Observatory Network, 2017
