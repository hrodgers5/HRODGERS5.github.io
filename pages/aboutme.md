<p> I work with farmers and researchers to create agricultural systems that are sustainable, resilient to climatic stress, and economically secure. I help ensure that farmers can access the information they need to support the health of their lands, and that their challenges and insights inform how we do research. My current projects focus on drought adaptation, soil health, alternative grains crops, and supporting farmer-researcher partnerships. I graduated in 2024 from the University of Wyoming with my PhD in soil science, and before that, I was an intern with The Land Institute and taught English in an agricultural community in Nepal. In my free time, I like to hike and canoe around Laramie, Wyoming, and teach ceramics at a community clay studio.
