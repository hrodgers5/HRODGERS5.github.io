|   I work with farmers to create agricultural systems that are sustainable, resilient to climatic stress, and economically secure. In part, this involves facilitating collaboration among local farmers, researchers, and service providers. Some of my current research and outreach areas include soil health management, alternative grains crops, and rotations that incorporate perennials. My work is informed by the concept of Natural Systems Agriculture, which aims to create agricultural systems that mimic our native ecosystems and the benefits they provide. In my free time, I likes to hike, bike, and canoe around Laramie, Wyoming, and teach pottery.

Some of my past work includes:
-University of Wyoming, PhD in Soil Science, 2020-2024
-Fulbright Nepal, English Teacher, 2019
-The Land Institute, Research Intern, 2018
-Oberlin College, Bachelors in Biology and Neuroscience, 2014-2018
-National Ecological Observatory Network, Field Technician, 2017
